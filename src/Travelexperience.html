        <p1>TARAWOODS TANUAN, BATANGAS - I came here sometime in 2008 during a Payer and Fasting event in my church. I was under a recovery program at that time and this was a part of it. With its serene surroundings, this is just a great place to escape the chaos and pollution of the city, to de-stress, to enjoy nature and to be revitalized and be refreshed.
